The aim of this project is to improve your UI Kit.
We've already given you the solution of Project I that you will improve so that:

All Components are customizable from the outside (they accept any attribute).
All Components will keep their default classNames (for example ui-container for the Container Component). However, you should still be able to add a `className` on the Component which will be added next to the default className. Here are the default classes:
Container: ui-container
Input: ui-textfield
Link: ui-link
Button: ui-button
Examples:
Example #1: <Container className="main"><Container> will render <div className="ui-container main"></div>
Example #2: <Container className="store"><Container> will render <div className="ui-container store"></div>
Notice how you can use the Container with your own class and it will end up using that class as well as the default "ui-container". This behaviour should be the same for all components.

Note
The <Input /> should still default the type to "text".
You do NOT need to import the index.css as it is automatically injected in the page.
